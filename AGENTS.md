# AGENTS.md — NIIGHTMARE Esports website

Operational handoff for AI coding agents (Codex et al.). Read this before touching
the project. The user-facing content guide is in [README.md](./README.md), but note
the README's "Brand & tech notes" + "Deploy" sections are **outdated** — this file
overrides them.

## What this is
Dark, aggressive **esports website** for NIIGHTMARE Esports (Lao PDR), competing in
**Mobile Legends: Bang Bang (MLBB)** and **eFootball**. Next.js 15 (App Router) ·
TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · bilingual EN/Lao. Live at
**https://niightmareesport.com** (custom domain, registered + DNS on Cloudflare,
records DNS-only/grey so Vercel issues SSL). The old `niightmare-esport.vercel.app`
still deploys but **some ISPs (Lao PDR) block `*.vercel.app`** — always use the
custom domain. `SITE_URL` (lib/seo.ts) defaults to it; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
overrides if set.

## Repo layout — IMPORTANT
The real project root is nested **one level deeper** than the folder you probably
opened:
```
.../Website/niightmareesport/            <- outer folder (often the cwd)
.../Website/niightmareesport/Niightmare-Esport/   <- ACTUAL project root (package.json here)
```
Run all `npm`/`next`/`vercel` commands from the inner `Niightmare-Esport` folder.

## Running locally (Node is NOT on PATH)
This machine has no global Node. Use a portable build:

- **With npm/npx** (for vercel, installs): `C:\Users\iTAPE\AppData\Local\nodejs-portable\node-v22.12.0-win-x64` (node 22.12, npm 10.9). Prepend to PATH:
  ```powershell
  $env:PATH = "C:\Users\iTAPE\AppData\Local\nodejs-portable\node-v22.12.0-win-x64;" + $env:PATH
  ```
- **node.exe only** (run the Next bin directly, no npm): `C:\Users\iTAPE\AppData\Local\OpenAI\Codex\bin\<hash>\node.exe` (node 24).

Start the dev server (deps are already installed):
```powershell
$node = "C:\Users\iTAPE\AppData\Local\OpenAI\Codex\bin\<hash>\node.exe"
Set-Location "D:\Picture D\Niigtmare Project\Website\niightmareesport\Niightmare-Esport"
& $node "node_modules\next\dist\bin\next" dev      # http://localhost:3000
```
A dev server is often **already running on :3000** from a prior session and picks up
edits via fast-refresh — check `Invoke-WebRequest http://localhost:3000/` before
starting another (a second just fails to bind).

Verify a change shipped: fetch `/` and look for a new marker (CSS class / string) +
absence of the Next error overlay. For headless screenshots, use the Playwright-core
that ships with the playwright-go bundle, launched against installed Edge:
`import { chromium } from 'file:///C:/Users/iTAPE/AppData/Local/ms-playwright-go/1.57.0/package/index.mjs'`
then `chromium.launch({ channel: 'msedge', headless: true })`.

## Deploy (Vercel)
**Primary: git push.** The repo now has a git remote and the production project is wired
to auto-deploy on push to `main`:
```powershell
git push origin main   # -> builds + ships to https://niightmareesport.com
```
- Remote `origin` = `https://github.com/JinAtlantic/-Niightmare-esport.git` — **note the
  LEADING DASH** in the repo name. A second repo `JinAtlantic/Niightmare-Esport` (no dash)
  exists and is stale; the live project must stay connected to the **dash** repo. Pushing
  to the wrong repo silently fails to deploy.
- Production branch is `main`. Every push to `main` triggers a production build.

**Fallback: Vercel CLI** straight from the local folder (cloud build, does NOT touch local
`.next`) — use if the git integration is ever broken:
```powershell
$env:PATH = "C:\Users\iTAPE\AppData\Local\nodejs-portable\node-v22.12.0-win-x64;" + $env:PATH
$tok = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable('VERCEL_TOKEN','User')
Set-Location "D:\Picture D\Niigtmare Project\Website\niightmareesport\Niightmare-Esport"
npx --yes vercel@latest --prod --yes --token $tok --scope jinatlantics-projects
```
- Token is a **User env var `VERCEL_TOKEN`** — read it from the *User* scope (a freshly
  spawned shell won't see it in `$env:`). Never print/commit the token. Same token works
  for direct REST calls to `api.vercel.com` (the sandbox CAN reach the API host).
- `--scope jinatlantics-projects` is mandatory in non-interactive mode.
- Project `niightmare-esport`, projectId `prj_OFnaJcx0iXKSM9RxGoBK2MWvfS0B`, teamId
  `team_AszcleMwKqTx5nCPfaKp5yMj`.
- Deployment protection (sso login wall) is already disabled; if a new project re-enables
  it, PATCH `ssoProtection: null` via the Vercel API.
- This sandbox can't reach the live host directly — verify the live site through the
  jina proxy, requesting raw HTML so meta/markers survive:
  `Invoke-WebRequest "https://r.jina.ai/https://niightmareesport.com" -Headers @{ "X-Return-Format"="html" }`.

## Gotchas (will burn time if ignored)
- **`next/font/google` HANGS the build here** (silent, never returns). All fonts are
  therefore **self-hosted** via `next/font/local` (woff2 in `app/fonts/`, vars
  `--font-rajdhani/-barlow/-mono/-lao`). Do NOT switch any font back to
  `next/font/google`.
- **Lao font + mixed scripts**: the Lao face is **Noto Sans Lao** (`--font-lao`,
  self-hosted; chosen over the formal Phetsarath for readability). In Lao mode
  (`html.lang-lo`, see `app/globals.css`) each role keeps its **Latin font FIRST**
  with `var(--font-lao)` only as a fallback, so Latin glyphs stay on-brand
  (Chakra Petch / Barlow / JetBrains Mono) and only Lao glyphs use Noto Sans Lao.
  Don't re-add a blanket `font-family: var(--font-lao) !important` — that's what
  made English text render in the Lao face.
- **Don't run `npm run build` while the dev server is up** — the production output
  clobbers the dev `.next` and the running server starts throwing `Cannot find module
  './###.js'`. If it happens: kill :3000, `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next`, restart
  `next dev`.
- **`next/og` routes (`/opengraph-image`, `/twitter-image`) crash under `next dev` on
  node 24** — they render fine via `next build`/`next start` on node 22. Not worth
  debugging the dev crash.
- If a build is killed mid-run, `.next` is left corrupt (`ENOENT rename
  .next/export/500.html`) — `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next` and rebuild.

## Design system — "Premium Violet Void"
Source of truth is [`tailwind.config.ts`](./tailwind.config.ts). Use the tokens, don't
hardcode hexes.
- Palette: `void #0B0710`, `crypt #16101F`, `crypt2 #1C1428`, `edge #2A2138`,
  `edge-bright #3A2E50`, `amethyst #A855F7` (primary), `glow #C77DFF`, `spectre #C9B4F6`,
  `soul #ECE7F2` (text), `ash`/`ash-dim` (muted). Result colors `win #34D399`,
  `loss #FB7185` (also the rose/live accent), `draw`.
- Display font is **Chakra Petch** (clipped, blade-like), exposed as both `font-display`
  and `font-rajdhani`. Body `font-barlow`, data/`font-mono`, Lao `font-lao`.
- **Sharp corners**: border-radius is capped at 4px (`rounded-*` ≤ `md`); only `rounded-full`
  is round. Aggressive, bladed aesthetic — see the `.scythe-line` skewed gradient rule in
  `app/globals.css` and `ScytheIcon`.
- Glow shadows: `shadow-glow`, `shadow-glow-accent`, `shadow-glow-soft`; animations
  `pulseGlow`, `fadeInUp`, `rise`, `slashSlide` in the config.
- `keep-latin` opts an element back into the Latin display font inside Lao mode (team
  wordmarks, in-game names).

## Content & data
All site content is JSON in [`/data`](./data) (`news/roster/matches/sponsors/site/
translations`); every translatable value is `{ "en": "...", "lo": "..." }` — keep both.
Shapes are documented in the README. The **admin editor at `/admin`** is cloud-backed
(Vercel Blob) and writes live without a redeploy; it's gated off in production. The admin
session cookie (`nm_admin`, `lib/adminAuth.ts` + `app/api/admin/login`) is **`sameSite: "lax"`**
(strict withheld it on bookmark/link navigations → re-login every visit) and lasts
**365 days** (`SESSION_MAX_AGE`), so a device stays signed in; "Log out" clears it.
**Image uploads** (admin media via `ImageField` → `/api/admin/upload`, and customer
payment slips) go to the public **Supabase Storage `uploads` bucket** (`lib/supabaseStorage.ts`),
NOT Vercel Blob — the free Blob store gets suspended at its usage cap
(`limits-exceeded-suspended`), which silently breaks every upload as "Could not upload image".
`ImageField` (`components/admin/ui.tsx`) **auto-resizes every upload in the browser**
before POSTing: it re-encodes to a ≤1200px JPEG and keeps lowering quality (to 0.6)
then dimensions until the blob is safely under the 4 MB server cap — so an upload of
any size always succeeds (a smaller transparent PNG is kept as-is; a huge GIF/SVG we
can't re-encode shows a plain-Thai "too big" message). The upload `folder` allowlist
lives in BOTH `app/api/admin/upload/route.ts` (`FOLDERS` set) and the `ImageField`
`folder` union — add a name to both to allow a new subfolder (`teams`/`players`/
`staff`/`sponsors`/`shop`).
**Behind-the-Team / roster members** use **Supabase** (service-role writes, login-gated
inline editor) — needs 3 env vars, see `.env.example`. Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`
and fill secrets; never commit `.env.local`.

### Adding a field to a player / match / upcoming-match
`players`, `matches`, and `upcoming_match` are **Supabase tables** (read via
`lib/contentFromSupabase.ts`, written via `lib/migrate.ts` + `lib/supabaseWrite.ts`);
the bundled `/data/*.json` is only a fallback seed. To add a field, either reuse a
spare legacy column **or** add an idempotent `alter table … add column if not exists`
to `supabase/schema.sql` (the "Backfill columns" block) **and run it in the Supabase
SQL editor before deploying** — admin saves 500 on a missing column. Legacy-column
reuse in `players`: `win_rate`→`fmvp`, `gear_device`→`tenures` (JSON),
`gear_audio`→`liquipedia`. The 3-letter opponent short code lives in
`matches.opponent_abbr` / `upcoming_match.opponent_abbr` (shown by `OpponentLogo`
/ `UpcomingMatch` when no opponent logo is set; `opponentMonogram()` in
`components/cards/OpponentLogo.tsx` resolves it).

**Writing prod content from a local script (no dev server, no redeploy):** the admin session
token is a signed HMAC of `ADMIN_SECRET` (`lib/adminAuth.ts` `makeToken`) — a local node script
can mint it and `PUT https://www.niightmareesport.com/api/admin/data?file=<matches|site|…>` with
`Cookie: nm_admin=<token>`, which writes Supabase **and** revalidates the public pages instantly.
The sandbox can reach the live host (apex 308→www). `matches` replaces the whole table (send the
full list), `site` upserts many fields (GET the full object first, edit only what you need, PUT it
back — else other fields get nulled). **`scripts/sync-results.mjs`** uses exactly this: it reads
NIIGHTMARE's Liquipedia played matches (proper `User-Agent`), diffs against live matches (only
results **newer than the latest already on the site** — never back-fills), and on `--apply`
publishes the new results + per-game VOD links. Driven by the **`/sync-results`** slash command
(`.claude/commands/`), which is confirm-first. The owner runs it on demand (stays manual — no
scheduled/auto routine, by choice); opponent names/tournaments come from Liquipedia as-is.

**Editable JSON blocks on the "site" section** (About Us, Niightmare Roadmap) live in
single `jsonb` columns on `site_settings`: `about_us` and `roadmap`. Pattern for any
new editable-content block: (1) `alter table site_settings add column if not exists
<col> jsonb;` in `schema.sql` **and run it in Supabase before the admin can save it**;
(2) persist it in BOTH `lib/supabaseWrite.ts` and `lib/migrate.ts` (the `site_settings`
upsert); (3) read it back in `lib/contentFromSupabase.ts` (`<key>: (c.<col> as …) ??
undefined`); (4) define `DEFAULT_*` + a `resolve*()` merge in a `lib/*.ts`, edit it via
a sub-editor in `HomeEditor`. The component reads `useContent().site.<key>` and falls
back to the default — so the block renders before anything is ever saved.

**Roster PAGE copy is admin-editable (2026-07-06):** the /admin → Roster **"หน้า Roster
(Page)"** tab (hero title/intro, tab + tier labels, stat labels) used to be **seed-only**
— the roster save wrote only the `players`/`members` tables and reads rebuilt `page` from
`data/roster.json`, so Page-tab edits never surfaced (the Players/Staff tabs always
persisted). It's now stored as a jsonb blob on **`site_settings.roster_page`** (same
pattern as `about_us`/`roadmap`): written in `lib/supabaseWrite.ts` (roster branch,
guarded by `hasColumns`) and merged over the seed page in `lib/contentFromSupabase.ts`.
Migration (already run live): `alter table public.site_settings add column if not exists
roster_page jsonb;`. NB: this is the roster-key equivalent of the sponsors page-copy
gotcha below — but roster page copy now DOES go live.

## Recently redesigned
**Sponsors revamp (2026-07-04):** `components/clients/SponsorsClient.tsx` is now **logo-first** —
a compact tile grid (2 cols mobile → 4 lg) where the logo is the hero and each tile opens a
redesigned popup with **real per-sponsor data**: a category chip, an "About" description, and a
**Connect** row of social/contact icons (only filled ones render, like a player card) + a Visit
Website button. The popup is **portaled to `document.body`** (`createPortal`) so it always centres
in the viewport (a transformed ancestor otherwise anchored the `fixed` layer to the section).
`Sponsor` gained `category`/`description` (Bilingual) + `socials`
(`facebook/instagram/tiktok/youtube/whatsapp/phone`; website = `Sponsor.url`) — persisted as
**three jsonb columns on `sponsors`** (`sponsorRows` in `lib/migrate.ts`, read in
`lib/contentFromSupabase.ts` via `jsonBi`), edited in **/admin → Sponsors**. New icons
`GlobeIcon`/`PhoneIcon` in `components/ui/Icons.tsx`. Columns to run before saving sponsors in
admin (else the save 500s): `alter table public.sponsors add column if not exists category jsonb;`
`… description jsonb;` `… socials jsonb;` (already run on the live DB).
- **Admin editor is an accordion** now (`components/admin/SponsorsEditor.tsx`): each partner is a
  collapsed row (logo thumb + name + status) you click to edit — far easier for a long list.
- **Sponsorship Tiers were removed** (unused, never rendered): the editor UI + the page copy's
  tier fields are gone, and the `sponsor_tiers` table was **wiped to 0 rows**. `SponsorTier` /
  `tierRows` / the `sponsor_tiers` read+write still exist in the lib layer (harmless) and the
  editor passes `tiers` through untouched so a save doesn't recreate them.
- **CTA band** is just a short **"Become Our Partner" / "ມາຮ່ວມເປັນພາກສ່ວນກັບພວກເຮົາ"** invite
  (hardcoded `COPY.ctaInvite`) + buttons; the descriptive `ctaBody` paragraph was dropped.
- **Footer partner marquee** (`components/layout/SponsorMarquee.tsx`, mounted in `Footer.tsx`)
  **replaced the Quick Links column**: a full-width band of partner logos auto-scrolling
  left→right (CSS `.marquee-track`/`@keyframes sponsor-marquee` in `globals.css`, seamless via a
  duplicated aria-hidden second copy, edge fade mask, pause-on-hover, frozen under
  reduced-motion). Footer top grid dropped to 2 cols. Logos show once uploaded; until then each
  partner renders as a **name wordmark**. Shared `partnersLabel` (footer + home `PartnerStrip` +
  sponsors page) Lao is **"partners ຂອງເຮົາ"**.

**GOTCHA — sponsors `page` copy is SEED-ONLY:** the sponsors-file `page` block (hero/labels/
valueProps/CTA) is NOT persisted to Supabase — `supabaseWrite`'s `sponsors` branch only writes
the `sponsors` + `sponsor_tiers` tables, and `contentFromSupabase` builds `page` from
`data/sponsors.json`. So editing page copy in /admin does nothing live; to change it you must
edit the seed + deploy. Per-sponsor rows (name/logo/category/description/socials) DO persist via
Supabase and show instantly. Publish sponsor rows to live from a script by PUTting
`/api/admin/data?file=sponsors` with a minted admin token (send the full sponsors list +
current tiers so nothing is wiped) — same pattern as `scripts/sync-results.mjs`.

**Sponsor data status (as of 2026-07-04):** 10 real sponsors are live (Apollo Entertainment,
M Frolic, Vibes Cafe VTE, SV Garage, Senglao Café, WHR, DML, Good Start, IPEDD, Lao Esports
Federation). Verified links filled: Senglao (FB/IG/web/phone), LESF (FB/web), Vibes (IG), IPEDD
(FB), M Frolic (FB). **Still needs owner input:** what WHR / DML / Good Start are (not found
online — left generic, no links), correct FB links for Apollo + SV Garage, and **real logo files
for all 10** (currently wordmark fallback everywhere).

`components/sections/UpcomingMatch.tsx` — the home "UPCOMING MATCH" fixture card was
rebuilt as a split-arena broadcast card (mobile-first: stacked → side-by-side on `md`,
glassmorphism team zones, forged diamond VS on a blade seam, divided tale-of-the-tape
strip). Keep edits to Tailwind classes + JSX layout; the data hooks/props are stable.

**Live score (2026-07-03):** when `upcomingMatch.status === "live"` the card shows a rose
"Live score" board from `upcomingMatch.score` (e.g. a BO3 at "1-0"), editable in /admin. An
open fan page **polls `GET /api/content` every ~25s while live** so the tally climbs without a
refresh, and reloads once when the admin flips the status away from "live" (match finished).
No new columns — reuses the existing `score` field. The **/admin editor** (`HomeEditor.tsx`
"นัดต่อไป") was reorganized to be **status-driven**: a big status picker up top, then only the
relevant box shows (rose LIVE-SCORE box when live; RESULT box when finished), followed by
grouped cards (คู่แข่ง / งาน–รอบ / วัน–เวลา / ถ่ายทอดสด) + the schedule-queue popup. The finished
box has **two actions**: `finishToMatches()` ("✅ บันทึกผลลงหน้า Match" — appends the result to
/matches then clears the card; **works even with no queued next row**, fixing the dead-end where
the last match of the day couldn't be recorded) and `promoteNext()` (append + advance to the
first schedule row; shown only when one exists). Both share `appendFinishedToMatches()`. The 24h
time field defaults the date to today when a time is typed before a date (`todayBkkDate()`).

`components/sections/AboutUs.tsx` — home "About Us" band below `RecentResults`: a
single centred manifesto led by a large scythe-tick "WHO WE ARE" heading + an outlined
violet accent word. All copy is admin-editable via `site.aboutUs` (HomeEditor → "About
Us") with defaults in `lib/about.ts` (`DEFAULT_ABOUT` / `resolveAbout`). Players also
carry an optional `liquipedia` URL shown in the profile modal. The Club Dossier / stats
and "Team Snapshot" blocks were removed.

## Matches page (2026-06)
`/matches` (`components/clients/MatchesClient.tsx`):
- **Scoreboard** = W / L / win-rate tiles (colour-accented); stats are for the selected
  game + year, independent of the result/tournament filters.
- **Filters** (all dropdowns, visible labels): Game · Year · Result · Sort, then a
  full-width **Tournament** dropdown. Tournament options are collapsed to one entry per
  event family — `baseName()` strips `Season N` / `S7` / `M5–M8` / year tokens — and
  grouped into `<optgroup>`s by tier (S→A→B→C, untiered "Other" last). The match list
  still cards each season separately.
- **Tier colours**: each match's left blade + each tournament group's tier badge are
  coloured by `tournamentTier(name)` in `lib/tiers.ts` (bronze C / cyan B / silver A /
  gold S; non-main events fall back to brand violet). `tournamentTier` is the single
  source of truth for tier classification — extend its regex to tier a new event.
- **Niightmare Roadmap** = a button above the W/L/win-rate scoreboard opening
  `RoadmapModal`. It shows H1/H2 tabs, a bilingual language toggle, and a
  current-status tracker. Content is admin-editable via `site.roadmap`
  (HomeEditor → "Niightmare Roadmap") with defaults/types in `lib/roadmap.ts`.
  The active card is controlled by `activeStageId` (default `h1-wild-card`).
  Current flow: MCCM Season 1 rank 1 goes to MSC x EWC Wild Card, then Wild
  Card rank 1 enters Group Stage; MCCM Season 2 rank 1 goes direct to M-Series,
  rank 2 goes to Wild Card for the final M-Series slot.

## Shop / jersey ordering (IMPLEMENTED — 2026-06)
`/shop` is a live on-site jersey ordering flow. **No 3D viewer** — an early
placeholder used a procedural Three.js model but the user dropped it as fiddly;
`components/shop/JerseyModelViewer.tsx` still exists (vanilla Three.js) but is no
longer imported, so three.js is not bundled on the page. **Do NOT reintroduce
`@react-three/fiber`** — Next 15 serves a React-19 client runtime while the repo
pins React 18, so fiber's reconciler reads removed internals (`ReactCurrentBatchConfig`)
and crashes only at client runtime (tsc/lint/build all pass). Any future 3D must be
vanilla Three.js in a `useEffect`.

Product model (one jersey, one edition): currency LAK, base **329,000 ກີບ**, sizes
S–4XL where **3XL +10,000 / 4XL +20,000** (per-size `surcharge`). Back name/number are
**locked** to "NIIGHTMARE ESPORTS #7" (reserved, shown with a rights note). The page is
two tabs styled like the Achievements page: **Order** (reserved note + size→quantity
rows, supporting several sizes per order and a typeable qty up to 999; customer name,
phone/WhatsApp, courier dropdown with a free-text "Other", province/city/branch) and
**My Orders** (the buyer's saved orders from `localStorage`, with an empty state).
Bilingual EN/Lao throughout.

**Front/back jersey gallery (2026-07-06):** the Order tab leads with
`components/shop/JerseyShowcase.tsx` — a premium viewer showing the shirt with a
Front/Back toggle + two thumbnails and a tap-to-zoom fullscreen lightbox (portaled to
`document.body`; padding-bottom box, NOT CSS aspect-ratio, for mobile Safari; plain
`<img>` since the photos live on Supabase Storage). Before photos are uploaded it renders
an on-brand placeholder (shirt glyph + #number + "coming soon"). The two images are
`shop.frontImage` / `shop.backImage` on the `site.shop` jsonb blob (no migration —
`resolveShop` in `lib/shop.ts` passes them through), uploaded in **/admin → Shop → "รูปเสื้อ
(หน้า/หลัง)"** via `ImageField folder="shop"`. Owner will fill the real photos later
(recommend JPEG, or a transparent PNG cut-out for the most premium look on the violet bg).

**Buying does NOT require sign-in** — the site has **no user login at all** (manual slip
verification is the real safeguard). "My Orders" is tracked locally in `localStorage` on the
buyer's device under one base key; `shop_orders.user_email` is left empty.

Order flow is **reserve → pay** (two `POST /api/shop/order` calls, distinguished by
`body.intent`): **Order & pay** first prices server-side and inserts the order as
`status='awaiting_payment'` (`intent:"reserve"`), then opens the payment popup. The
popup is **portaled to `document.body`** with background scroll locked so it always
centres in the viewport (a transformed ancestor used to capture the `fixed` positioning).
Attaching a slip + "I've transferred" (`intent:"pay"`, sends the reserved `orderId`)
updates that row to `status='paid_declared'`, uploads the slip, fires Admin Web Push
alerts, and then shows the success tick → popup self-closes → My Orders tab. Payment is **self-declared**
(no gateway). Formspree email for shop paid-order declarations is **disabled by default**
so fake slips / high order volume do not consume the free Formspree quota; only enable it
as a secondary channel with `SHOP_ORDER_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=true`. The team verifies in **/admin → Orders** and advances status
(awaiting_payment → paid_declared → verified → shipped → cancelled).

**Pay window / My Orders:** a reserved order shows in the buyer's `localStorage` **My
Orders** with a live **24-hour countdown** + a **Pay now** button (reopens the popup for that
order); past the window it's auto-removed from My Orders / displays as cancelled
(`isOrderExpired` / `payWindowRemaining` in `lib/shop.ts`, `SHOP_PAYMENT_WINDOW_HOURS = 24`).
My Orders uses a single localStorage key `nm-shop-orders` on the device (no login, so it is
not account-scoped). Because My Orders is otherwise localStorage-only, it now **syncs live status from the
server** when the buyer opens the tab: `GET /api/shop/order/status?ids=<uuid,…>` (public,
returns only `status` + `shippingImageUrl` by UUID) merges the latest into localStorage.
This is what makes admin status changes visible to the buyer — badges map
`paid_declared`→processing, `verified`→preparing, `shipped`→"shipped, please wait",
and an id the server no longer returns (admin deleted it) flips the local copy to
cancelled. Each My Orders card has a read-only **Order details** `<details>` (the data the
buyer entered) and, once shipped/verified, shows the **shipping image** the team attached.
/admin → Orders shows expired awaiting orders with a "หมดเวลา 24 ชม" tag. The cancel is a
**display-only** computation on both sides (no cron); admin can still set status manually.

**Manual-verification aids (no gateway):** the buyer transfers the **exact order total**
(no amount tampering — an earlier random-kip scheme was dropped so customers never feel
overcharged). Each order gets a short **reference code** (`NM-XXXXX`, generated client-side
on reserve, sent as `ref`, sanitised by `cleanRefCode`, stored in `shop_orders.ref_code`)
shown big + **copyable** (clipboard) in the pay popup and in My Orders. The instruction to
put it in the transfer note is **admin-editable** (`shop.bank.refNote`, bilingual, set in
/admin → Shop). The buyer must
also **attach a payment slip** (required to enable "I've transferred"); the image is
downscaled client-side, posted as a base64 data URL on `slip`, uploaded to the public
**Supabase Storage** `uploads` bucket server-side (via `lib/supabaseStorage.ts`, service
role), and stored as `shop_orders.slip_url`.
Expired (>24h) reservations are auto-removed from the buyer's My Orders, and a buyer can
delete any of their own My Orders entries. Deleting an **awaiting_payment** entry also hard-
deletes the server/admin copy (`DELETE /api/shop/order` with the order UUID; the handler only
removes rows still `status='awaiting_payment'`, so a paid/processing order can't be erased
this way). Deleting a paid/processing entry stays localStorage-only — the Supabase copy
remains for the team.

**/admin → Orders** is split into **4 status sub-tabs** (with counts): รอชำระ
(awaiting_payment), กำลังตรวจ (paid_declared — the default/actionable bucket), จ่ายแล้ว
(verified + cancelled), ส่งแล้ว (shipped). Each card **headlines the order ref code + amount**
(the two fields matched against the slip) + the slip thumbnail; customer name/phone/courier/
address fold into a `<details>` dropdown (plus the signed-in buyer's `user_email` if present).
The **ส่งแล้ว tab leads with a sales report** — total revenue, units sold, and per-size,
grouped by **day / month / year** (`SalesReport` in `OrdersEditor.tsx`). Each order's shown
**time ("เวลาโอน"), the list sort and the sales report all use `paid_at`** — the **immutable
moment the buyer declared their transfer** (slip attached + "I've transferred"), set once by
the PAY route and **never touched by admin status changes**, so advancing an order can't drift
its time (`orderTime()` falls back to `updated_at`→`created_at` for rows saved before the
column existed). **NB: the `shop_orders.updated_at` DB trigger does NOT fire in the live DB**,
so the pay route and the admin status PATCH set `updated_at` (and the pay route `paid_at`)
**explicitly** in the update payload. Run `alter table public.shop_orders add column if not
exists paid_at timestamptz;` in Supabase — the routes degrade gracefully until then.

Admin Orders also has: a **search box** (matches ref code / name / email / phone) + a
**newest⇄oldest sort** toggle; a **⚠ duplicate flag** when an order shares a phone or
signed-in email with another; **tap-to-call (`tel:`) + copy** for phone/ref/amount/email; a
relative **"x นาทีที่แล้ว" time**; a prominent **quick-advance** button (paid→verified→
shipped); and on verified/shipped orders a **shipping-image uploader** (`PATCH` with a
base64 `shippingImage` → uploaded to the `uploads` bucket `shop-shipping/` → stored in
`shop_orders.shipping_image_url`, shown to the buyer). The red **"ยกเลิก & ลบ"** button is a
**hard delete** (`DELETE /api/admin/orders`, `window.confirm` first) — used to purge junk /
mismatched-transfer orders; the legacy `cancelled` status is no longer set from the UI.
**The DELETE route now also purges the order's uploaded images** (`slip_url` in `shop-slips/`
+ `shipping_image_url` in `shop-shipping/`) from the public `uploads` bucket via
`deleteFromStorage()` (`lib/supabaseStorage.ts`, derives the in-bucket path from the public
URL) — best-effort, never fails the delete. Before this, deleting a row orphaned its slip in
Storage. A one-off orphan sweep (list `shop-slips/`+`shop-shipping/`, remove files no order's
`slip_url`/`shipping_image_url` references) is the safe cleanup for pre-existing orphans.

**QR framing:** the QR is drawn as a CSS background on a square so a long bank-app
screenshot can be cropped to just the QR. `/admin → Shop` has zoom + X/Y position sliders
with a live preview; values live in `shop.bank.qrZoom/qrX/qrY` (jsonb, no migration) and
both the admin preview and the shop popup share `qrFrameStyle()` in `lib/shop.ts`.

Files: `lib/shop.ts` (config/types/`resolveShop`/`computeOrder`/`validateOrder`; also a
leftover fit model used only by the unused viewer), `app/shop/page.tsx`,
`components/shop/ShopClient.tsx`, `app/api/shop/order/route.ts`,
`app/api/admin/orders/route.ts` (GET/PATCH/DELETE), `app/api/shop/order/status/route.ts`
(public buyer status sync), `components/admin/ShopEditor.tsx`,
`components/admin/OrdersEditor.tsx` (+ tab wired in `AdminApp.tsx`). All shop *config*
(price, sizes, stock, bank/QR, couriers, contact link, rights note) lives in the
`site_settings.shop` jsonb blob and is edited in **/admin → Shop** — same editable-JSON
pattern as `site.aboutUs`/`site.roadmap`.

Owner setup still pending (placeholders shipped): upload the real bank **QR** + account
+ the "Ask for more info" contact link in /admin → Shop. The order route degrades
gracefully if optional columns haven't been added — run these in the Supabase SQL editor
to persist them: `alter table public.shop_orders add column if not exists items jsonb;`
`alter table public.shop_orders add column if not exists ref_code text;`
`alter table public.shop_orders add column if not exists slip_url text;`
`alter table public.shop_orders add column if not exists shipping_image_url text;`
**Admin push alerts (Web Push):** when a buyer declares a transfer (the PAY intent flips
an order to `paid_declared`), `app/api/shop/order/route.ts` calls `sendPushToAll()`
(`lib/push.ts`) to fire an **OS notification (sound + vibration) to every opted-in admin
device — even with the tab closed / phone asleep**. Admin is a shared password (no per-user
identity), so subscriptions are keyed per browser endpoint in the **`push_subscriptions`**
Supabase table (run its `create table` from `schema.sql`). Opt-in UI is
`components/admin/PushNotifications.tsx` (mounted in `AdminApp.tsx`): it registers the
service worker **`public/sw.js`**, requests permission, subscribes via `PushManager`, and
POSTs to `/api/admin/push/subscribe`; a **ทดสอบ** button hits `/api/admin/push/test`.
Requires VAPID env vars in `.env.local` **and Vercel** (`NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` is
baked at BUILD time → must be set before the deploy that should expose it):
`NEXT_PUBLIC_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` (generate once with
`node -e "console.log(require('web-push').generateVAPIDKeys())"`). The feature degrades to
"ยังไม่ได้ตั้งค่า VAPID keys" if unset. **iOS caveat:** Safari only delivers Web Push when
the site is added to the Home Screen (installed as a PWA); desktop Chrome/Edge/Firefox and
Android Chrome work directly.
Shop paid-order email notifications through the site's Formspree endpoint are optional
and off by default (`SHOP_ORDER_EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=false` / unset). Keep them off unless
the team intentionally wants email as a paid/secondary channel; Admin Web Push + `/admin`
Orders are the primary path and are not subject to Formspree's monthly submission limit.

**PWA / install prompt:** icons are driven via **`metadata.icons` (config-based), not the
`app/icon.png` file convention** — the files live in `public/` (`icon.png`, `apple-icon.png`,
`icon-{192,512}.png`) so the /admin route can cleanly override them. The public site uses
the NIIGHTMARE logo; **/admin uses the reaper icon** (`public/admin-icon-{192,512}.png`,
`public/admin-apple-icon.png`, flattened onto `#0B0710`) set in `app/admin/page.tsx`
`metadata.icons`. Don't re-add `app/icon.png`/`app/apple-icon.png` (file convention) — they
inject globally and would double up with the metadata icons on /admin.
**Two separate manifests** so the public site and /admin install as distinct Android apps
(a single shared manifest made Android treat the whole origin as one app, so you couldn't
add both): `public/site.webmanifest` (id/scope `/`, linked via root `layout.tsx`
`metadata.manifest`) and `public/admin.webmanifest` (id/scope `/admin`, linked via
`app/admin/page.tsx` `metadata.manifest`, which overrides the root for that route). Don't
re-add a file-based `app/manifest.ts` — it injects a global link on every page and would
double up on /admin. `components/ui/InstallPrompt.tsx` (mounted in the **public** branch of
`Chrome.tsx`, so never on /admin) is a dismissible bottom banner that nudges fans to add the
site: Android/desktop Chrome get a one-tap **Install** via the `beforeinstallprompt` event;
iOS Safari gets the Share→"Add to Home Screen" instructions. It registers `sw.js` site-wide
(its no-op `fetch` handler makes Chrome treat the site as installable), hides when already
in standalone, shows on every visit while ignored, and stays quiet for 3 days after an
explicit ✕ dismissal (`nm-install-dismissed`).

**Buyer order notifications (in-site, no login/push/install):**
`components/shop/OrderStatusToast.tsx` is mounted globally in the **public**
`Chrome.tsx` (never on /admin). On every public page it reads the buyer's local
order ids (`nm-shop-orders`), polls the public `GET /api/shop/order/status`
endpoint (settle + every 90s + on tab-focus, and only when this device actually
has orders), and pops an in-page toast the moment an order reaches a **positive
milestone the buyer hasn't seen yet** — currently `verified` ("payment confirmed"),
`packing` and `shipped`. Deliberately **no OS Web Push / no permission / no PWA install**
(so it also works on iPhone Safari) — the trade-off is the toast only appears
while the buyer has the site open. "Seen" is tracked in its own key
(`nm-shop-status-seen`, id→last-notified status) so each status toasts once even
across reloads; baseline falls back to the locally-stored status so a first run
never re-announces history. The toast links to `/shop?view=orders`, which
ShopClient reads on mount to open the **My Orders** tab. To change which statuses
notify, edit the `NOTIFY` map.

**Buyer order notifications (real Web Push, site closed):** on top of the in-site
toast, buyers can opt into OS push that fires even when the site is closed.
`components/shop/ShopPushToggle.tsx` (mounted at the top of the **My Orders** tab in
`ShopClient`, only when they have ≥1 order) registers `sw.js`, requests permission,
subscribes with the shared VAPID key, and POSTs the subscription + the device's
order UUIDs + lang to **`/api/shop/push/subscribe`** (public — the unguessable
order id is the capability, same model as the status endpoint; upserts the
**`shop_push_subscriptions`** table keyed on endpoint). When the admin PATCHes an
order to a milestone, `app/api/admin/orders/route.ts` calls **`sendPushForOrder()`**
(`lib/push.ts`) which pushes `verified`/`packing`/`shipped` copy (per-subscription
`lang`) to every device that opted in for that order id, pruning dead endpoints.
The toggle re-syncs `order_ids` whenever the buyer's My Orders list changes so a
new order is covered. Reuses the **same VAPID keys + `public/sw.js`** as admin push
(its `notificationclick` now routes by the payload `url`, so buyer alerts open
`/shop?view=orders`). **No install needed on Android/desktop; iPhone must Add-to-Home-
Screen first** (iOS Web Push limitation) — the toggle detects this and shows the
instructions. Run its migration in Supabase (routes degrade to a 503 until then):
`create table` for `shop_push_subscriptions` in `schema.sql`. To change the copy or
which statuses push, edit `SHOP_NOTIFY` in `lib/push.ts`.

Possible follow-ups (only if asked): a real payment gateway (e.g. BCEL OnePay) for
automatic transfer verification; a real `.glb` model + re-enabled vanilla-Three.js
preview.

## Claude Code handoff - launch hardening deploy (2026-07-04)

Latest launch-readiness work was completed, committed, pushed, and promoted on Vercel.

Commit:
- `1d60b7c Harden shop payment flow before launch`
- Pushed to `origin/main`
- Vercel deployment for this commit reached `READY` / `PROMOTED`

What changed:
- Hardened `app/api/shop/order/route.ts`:
  - `body.intent` must now be explicitly `"reserve"` or `"pay"`; missing/unknown intent returns 400.
  - PAY now requires a valid UUID `orderId`, a non-empty sanitized ref code, a payment slip, and configured Supabase storage.
  - PAY updates only an existing row matching `id + ref_code + status='awaiting_payment'`.
  - PAY rejects expired reservations by checking `created_at` against `SHOP_PAYMENT_WINDOW_HOURS`.
  - Removed the old fallback that inserted a fresh `paid_declared` order when update failed. This was the main pre-launch risk.
- Updated `next.config.js` CSP:
  - Dev keeps `'unsafe-eval'` so Next dev hydration/debugging works.
  - Added `https://va.vercel-scripts.com` for Vercel Analytics scripts.
- Updated `app/sitemap.ts` to include `/shop` and `/achievements`.
- Updated `/shop` metadata in `app/shop/page.tsx` so it no longer mentions a removed 3D model.
- Fixed nested landmark markup:
  - `components/layout/Chrome.tsx` no longer wraps `/admin` or `/live/overlay` in an extra `<main>`.
  - `components/shop/ShopClient.tsx` uses non-main wrappers inside the page.
  - `components/sections/RoadmapModal.tsx` uses `<section>` instead of nested `<main>`.
- Fixed Next Image sizing warnings in `components/cards/OpponentLogo.tsx` by switching opponent crests to `fill` inside a fixed relative box.

Validation already run locally before deploy:
- `npm.cmd run lint` passed.
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` passed.
- `npm.cmd audit --omit=dev` passed with 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm.cmd run build` passed.
- Production-mode local `next start` browser regression passed 30/30 with Playwright/Edge:
  - desktop/mobile `/`, `/matches`, `/roster`, `/sponsors`, `/shop`, `/achievements`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/live/overlay`
  - no broken images, horizontal overflow, Next error overlay, critical console errors, or stuck preloader
  - mobile nav + language toggle passed
  - Roadmap modal and sponsor modal passed
  - shop empty-form validation stayed client-side and did not POST
  - unauth admin routes returned 401
  - admin dashboard tabs rendered with a locally minted signed cookie

Production verification after deploy:
- `https://www.niightmareesport.com/` returned 200.
- `/matches` returned 200.
- `/shop` returned 200.
- `/api/content` returned 200 and included shop/sponsors data.
- `/api/admin/orders` returned 401 when unauthenticated.
- `/sitemap.xml` returned 200 and now includes `/shop` and `/achievements`.
- Live `/api/shop/order` guard checks:
  - POST with missing `intent` returned `400 {"error":"Invalid order intent"}`.
  - POST with `intent:"pay"` but no slip returned `400 {"error":"Payment slip is required"}`.

Important constraints for the next agent:
- Do not run `npm run build` while a dev server is active on port 3000; stop it first or `.next` can be corrupted for the running dev server.
- Do not perform a real reserve/pay test against production unless the user explicitly wants a real test order created. The live environment writes to real Supabase tables and uploads to real Supabase Storage.
- If a real final order smoke test is requested, create one small test order, attach a test slip, verify it appears in `/admin -> Orders`, then delete it from admin so the row and uploaded test images are purged.
- Current known non-code launch gaps: sponsor logos are still missing for all 10 sponsors, and WHR / DML / Good Start still have generic descriptions. This is content/asset work, not a code blocker.

## Opponent team logos — auto name→logo registry (2026-07-04)
`/matches` (and home RecentResults + UpcomingMatch) show opponent crests via a **central
registry** `lib/teamLogos.ts`: a map of *normalized* team name → `/public/teams/<slug>.png`.
`OpponentLogo` (`components/cards/OpponentLogo.tsx`) and `UpcomingMatch`'s `Crest` resolve the
logo as `safeImageSrc(match.opponentLogo) || safeImageSrc(teamLogoFor(name))` — so a per-match
`opponentLogo` still wins, otherwise the crest shows **automatically by team name** for every
past & future match, no per-match setup. Add a team once and it applies everywhere. Unknown
teams fall back to the initials monogram (unchanged). (`OpponentLogo` now renders via `fill`
inside a fixed relative box — Codex's Next-Image sizing fix — but the registry fallback is intact.)
- **55 real logos live** (52+ team names). Rebuild the registry block from disk with
  `node scripts/gen-team-logos-map.mjs` (reads `/public/teams/*.png` + the live opponent list,
  prints the `LOGO_BY_TEAM` entries to paste; **keys off the live opponent names**, so it also
  surfaces orphans — e.g. an opponent renamed "Bacon"→"Bacon time" needs the file renamed too).
- **HOW THE LOGOS WERE FETCHED (rate-limit gotcha — read before fetching more):** team names
  match Liquipedia MLBB pages; logo files are `<TeamName>_darkmode/_allmode/_lightmode.png`
  (some year-stamped, e.g. `Team_Falcons_2022_allmode.png`). **Do NOT hit liquipedia.net from our
  IP** — it hard-blocks the whole domain (api.php + `?action=render` + the `commons` CDN) after
  ~10 requests in a rolling ~15-min window, and that block cascades to the jina/wsrv proxies too.
  **The route that works = Photon (Jetpack CDN):**
  `https://i0.wp.com/liquipedia.net/commons/Special:FilePath/<File>?w=256` (also i1/i2). It fetches
  from ITS IP (never ours), follows the `Special:FilePath` redirect without needing the hash,
  resizes via `?w=`, and stays unblocked. A Photon 404 is a trustworthy "file absent". Scripts:
  `scripts/fetch-team-logos.mjs` (guess `<name>_mode.png` across name variants via Photon — got
  51/71), `scripts/fetch-known-logos.mjs` (confirmed filenames). The scorer rejects tournament/
  event logos (kept "RLG Vietnam" from grabbing `Vietnam_MLBB_Championship`). **darkmode files are
  white** (good on the void bg); **lightmode files are dark** (may vanish on the dark site — prefer
  darkmode/allmode). Owner can also just drop image files in `Website/LOGO/` (outer folder) or
  straight into `public/teams/` and ask to wire them; large ones get resized to 256px with
  PowerShell `System.Drawing` (webp isn't readable by System.Drawing — copy those as-is).
- **~15 teams still on the monogram** (odd-cased/absent filenames): The huns…, Nine Esports,
  Nadaeng, RLG Vietnam, ESB Titans/Legacy, DianFengYaoGuai, Vampire Kanagan, Onyx Prime,
  KalahKaluk, Royal Cybersports Club, CRIT x EVO, HTR Hybridz, IDONOTSLEEP. Need the exact
  Liquipedia filename (discovery via jina/allorigins was exhausted at the time) or an owner upload.
- Wrong-org risk: single/generic names can match a *different* org's Liquipedia page. Owner flagged
  Genius/Paradise/Bacon Time/MyWay as wrong autos → replaced with owner-supplied art (a wrong logo
  is worse than a monogram, so remove rather than guess). See also [country flags]: national flag
  beside a name is a **separate** system (`lib/opponentCountries.ts` → `OpponentFlag`, flagcdn);
  its keys must track live opponent-name changes too (fixed "bacon"→"bacon time").

## Achievements page figures are DERIVED from /matches (2026-07-04)
`components/clients/AchievementsClient.tsx` no longer hand-keeps its hero numbers. `lib/
achievementsDerived.ts` computes them from `content.matches.tournaments` (the SAME list /matches
uses), so they auto-update with results:
- **Total Winnings** = Σ `prizeToUsd(t.prize)` (parses "$3,000" / "29,000$" / "$3,072.51" / "-"),
  shown compact (`$109K`). **Championships** stat = count of first-place placements.
- **Placement table** (`PodiumDashboard`) = per-tier `{first,second,third,top3,all}` where tier =
  `tournamentTier(name)` and rank is parsed from the free-form `placement` ("Champion"/"Runner-up"/
  "1st"; ranges like "22nd–23rd" → not podium). Untiered events go in a new **"Other"** row
  (`PlacementSummaryTier` gained `"Other"`) so all 21 entries are counted, not just tiered ones.
- **GOTCHA — total can trail Liquipedia** if the source `prize` fields are blank/`-`. e.g. the
  ESL Snapdragon Pro Series S1/S3/S6, Kohai SEAC S2, VMWI rows have `-` → summed as 0, so the site
  showed $108,692 vs Liquipedia's $113,338 ($4,646 gap). Fix = fill those prizes in the data
  (admin / the tournaments source), NOT hardcode the total — the derivation is correct.

## /matches tournament dropdown — custom portaled Select (2026-07-04)
The Tournament filter in `MatchesClient.tsx` is a **custom `TournamentSelect`**, not a native
`<select>` (the list is long AND the filter sits inside two `overflow-hidden` ancestors, so a
native/absolute popup spilled off-screen). It renders its menu `position:fixed` **portaled to
`document.body`** (same trick as the sponsor/shop popups), anchored under the trigger via
`getBoundingClientRect()`, width = trigger, `maxHeight` capped to ~60vh (mobile-toolbar safe) and
clamped horizontally. Options **wrap** in a smaller font (no truncation) + tier group headers.
Closes on outside-click / Escape / scroll. The other filters (Game/Year/Result/Sort) stay native.

## Claude Code handoff - achievements, sponsors, roadmap, and Orders UX (2026-07-11)

This batch is complete, committed, pushed to `origin/main`, and deployed to production.
The latest Vercel deployment for `f8c2636` reached `READY`.

Commits, oldest to newest:
- `c74b5eb Remove achievements legacy view`
- `8a68bd1 Simplify sponsors CTA and admin`
- `9626328 Move sponsor CTA copy onto button`
- `5862f74 Make roadmap statuses admin controlled`
- `f8c2636 Redesign desktop order management`

### Achievements public page

File:
- `components/clients/AchievementsClient.tsx`

Changes:
- `/achievements` is now one Overview page only.
- Removed the Overview/Legacy tab switch and all public Legacy roster/staff rendering.
- Legacy data shapes and admin data were deliberately preserved for backward compatibility;
  they are simply not rendered on the public page.

### Sponsors CTA and admin cleanup

Files:
- `components/clients/SponsorsClient.tsx`
- `components/admin/SponsorsEditor.tsx`
- `data/sponsors.json`

Changes:
- The bottom Sponsors CTA contains one centered Facebook button only.
- The button label is `Become Our Partner` and its Lao translation. The same phrase is no
  longer rendered as a separate heading.
- The link comes from `site.contact.facebook`, with
  `https://facebook.com/niightmareesports` as a safe fallback.
- Removed the CTA email button.
- `/admin -> Sponsors` now exposes only live partner-row fields: name, logo, website,
  category, description, and per-sponsor social/contact channels.
- Removed the misleading Sponsors page-copy editor. That editor was seed-only and its
  saves never affected the public site because the Sponsors `page` block is not persisted
  by the Supabase sponsors branch.
- Removed unused page-copy fields from `data/sponsors.json`: old partner/tier labels,
  tier intro, CTA body, and old primary/secondary CTA definitions.

### Roadmap status control

Files:
- `components/admin/RoadmapEditor.tsx`
- `components/sections/RoadmapModal.tsx`
- `lib/roadmap.ts`

Changes:
- `/admin -> Home -> Niightmare Roadmap` now gives every stage a clear Thai status select:
  completed, competing now, or up next.
- Removed the manual `Active stage ID` field from the admin UI.
- Selecting a stage as active updates `activeStageId` automatically and demotes any other
  active stage to future. Changing the current active stage to past/future stores an empty
  `activeStageId`, and `resolveRoadmap()` now respects that instead of forcing the default.
- Public labels are bilingual and fixed by state: `COMPLETED`, `COMPETING NOW`, `UP NEXT`
  plus Lao equivalents. The future icon is now a calendar/clock rather than a lock.
- Existing `site_settings.roadmap` JSONB persistence is reused; no migration is required.

### Desktop Orders workspace

Files:
- `components/admin/OrdersEditor.tsx`
- `components/admin/AdminApp.tsx`

Changes:
- At `xl` desktop widths, `/admin -> Orders` is now a two-pane workspace:
  - left: dense, scannable order table;
  - right: sticky selected-order detail and action panel.
- The table exposes reference/customer, slip thumbnail, sizes/quantity/courier, amount,
  status, transfer timestamp, and duplicate warning without opening every card.
- Selecting an order is keyboard-accessible through a real button in the order cell.
- The detail panel centralizes reference/amount copy actions, full slip, item breakdown,
  customer/contact/address, shipping image management, quick advance, manual status, and
  permanent delete.
- Courier grouping and per-courier bulk advance remain available in desktop table headers.
- The existing mobile/narrow-screen card workflow is preserved below `xl`.
- Only the Orders tab expands the admin content width to `max-w-[1500px]`; other admin tabs
  keep the previous `max-w-5xl` layout.

### Validation and production checks

Local checks passed after the final Orders/Roadmap changes:
- `npm.cmd run lint`
- `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit`
- `npm.cmd run build`

Production checks after deploy:
- Vercel deployment for `f8c2636` reached `READY`.
- `https://www.niightmareesport.com/matches` returned 200.
- `https://www.niightmareesport.com/admin` returned 200.
- Deployed admin bundles contained the new Orders table/detail-panel markers and all three
  Roadmap admin status labels.
- Unauthenticated `GET /api/admin/orders` returned 401.
- No real production order was created, changed, or deleted during verification.

Known QA limitation and recommended first follow-up:
- The in-app browser backend was unavailable during the final Orders visual pass, so there
  is no screenshot-based desktop QA for the new two-pane layout yet.
- Before making further visual refinements, sign in to `/admin`, open Orders on a screen at
  least 1280px wide, and inspect the real table/detail split with existing orders. Do not
  change statuses or delete orders merely for visual testing.
- If the owner requests refinements, preserve all existing API calls and mobile cards; focus
  on desktop density, column widths, panel scroll behavior, and action prominence.

## Claude Code handoff - sponsors tile, achievements prize hero, player modal (2026-07-13)

All of this batch is complete, committed, pushed to `origin/main`, and deployed to
production (each change verified `READY` on Vercel before moving on). Commits, oldest to
newest:
- `888fd37 Document 2026-07-11 handoff in AGENTS.md` (docs only)
- `5ff9640 Show only name on sponsor tiles`
- `ebacb3f Feature total prize on achievements hero`
- `7f6449a Trim achievements hero to prize only`
- `4ef89e1 Make prize hero heading white`
- `d0e6a4d Refine player profile modal, drop bio`
- `131db26 Use image flag in player modal country tile`

Every change passed `npx.cmd tsc --noEmit` + `npm.cmd run lint` locally, then was verified
live by fetching the page HTML through `https://www.niightmareesport.com/...` (client-only
UI — the profile modal and count-up — is verified via tsc+lint per the headless-hydration
limitation, not screenshots).

### Sponsors — logo-first tiles show only the name
File: `components/clients/SponsorsClient.tsx`.
- The outer partner-grid tile (`SponsorCard`) now renders **only the logo + name** — the
  category caption line (and the hover "View" hint) under the name were removed. The full
  category chip + description + Connect channels still live in the sponsor **popup**
  (`SponsorModal`), untouched. Removed the now-dead `COPY.open` and the `category`/`pick`
  locals from `SponsorCard`.
- The per-sponsor `category` still ships in the page's serialized content data (the popup
  uses it) — so grepping the live HTML still finds e.g. "Automotive"; that's the data blob,
  not a visible tile caption. Confirm removal by the absence of the tile caption class
  (`... tracking-[0.16em] text-ash-dim`), which is what I checked live.

### Achievements — Total Record replaced by a single prize hero
File: `components/clients/AchievementsClient.tsx`.
- The four Total Record stat cards (Established year, Championships, World Championship,
  Winnings) were **replaced by one premium hero**: a colossal gold-to-violet gradient
  numeral of the **total prize won**, e.g. `$113,338`. It **counts up on mount** via a new
  local `useCountUp` hook (ease-out cubic, `requestAnimationFrame`) that **honours
  `prefers-reduced-motion`** (jumps to the final value) and starts from 0 (so SSR/first
  paint shows `$0` then animates — acceptable, it fades in with the container).
- The amount stays **derived live** from the tournament list: `deriveTotalWinnings(tournaments)`
  gives the raw number (now shown in **full** `toLocaleString`, not the old `$113K` compact),
  with the authored seed `winnings` stat value as the fallback when the list is empty. An
  `aria-label` carries the final exact figure for screen readers during the count.
- Copy: after two follow-up tweaks the hero now shows just the heading **"Total prize won"**
  (`labels.prizeWon`, bilingual, colored `text-soul`/white) + the numeral. The earlier
  "TOTAL RECORD" eyebrow and the "Across N tournaments" sub-line were both removed.
- Removed imports/vars that went unused: `deriveChampionships`, `formatUsdCompact`, and the
  `championships` memo. The **Placement Table** (`PodiumDashboard`) below is unchanged.
- The gradient is an arbitrary Tailwind value: `bg-[linear-gradient(176deg,#FBE9C0_2%,
  #F5C451_18%,#C77DFF_60%,#A855F7_100%)] bg-clip-text text-transparent` + a violet
  `drop-shadow` filter. If you touch it, keep spaces as underscores inside the arbitrary value.

### Roster — player profile modal redesign + country flag fix
File: `components/cards/PlayerModal.tsx` (the popup opened from a `PlayerCard`, lazy-loaded
via `PlayerModalHost`; the grid `PlayerCard` itself was **not** changed).
- **Removed the ABOUT / bio section** entirely (it read `player.description` and showed a
  "TBA" placeholder when empty). `player.description` is still a valid field on the type and
  still editable in admin — it's simply no longer rendered. Dropped the now-unused `bio`/`tba`
  locals and the `roster.about_label` usage.
- **Premium pass** on the right detail column: a bladed skewed accent bar under the IGN, the
  role is now a glowing bordered **chip** (was a left-rule label), and the vitals
  (country / birth date / age) are **`StatTile`s** — a new local component with a corner
  lucide icon (`MapPin`/`CalendarDays`/`Clock`), a violet hover edge + top hairline. Tenure
  rows gained a glowing amethyst node dot. Two-column layout + bottom social row unchanged.
- **Country now shows a real image flag + name.** The modal previously used `countryFlag()`
  (an emoji regional-indicator flag) which **does not render on Windows** (shows the letters
  "LA"). It now uses `countryFlagImageUrl()` (flagcdn PNG) like the grid card, plus the
  country name. It resolves the code the same way the card does — a copied
  `fallbackCountryCode(player)` (PH for a few known IGNs, else LA) — so a flag always appears.
  NB: `calculateAge` (in `lib/personProfile.ts`) is already **auto-computed** from `birthDate`
  vs `new Date()` at render, correctly decrementing before the birthday — it self-updates, no
  manual age field.

### Still-open / recommended follow-ups (unchanged, content/asset work)
- Sponsor **logo files** are still missing for all 10 partners (tiles render the name
  wordmark until real logos are uploaded in `/admin → Sponsors`, folder `sponsors`). The
  owner sent a single combined "Thank you" graphic of 8 logos but no separate files yet;
  from that image DML is a **delivery/logistics** brand ("Deliver·Move·Life") — one of the
  three previously-unknown partners (WHR / DML / Good Start).
- The 2026-07-11 desktop **Orders** two-pane layout still has no screenshot-based QA (see the
  previous handoff) — verify by signing into `/admin` on a ≥1280px screen with real orders.
